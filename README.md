# Project Overview
After a recent trip to Hawaii, I deveoped a concept for a hybrid surf and ice cream, Surf n' Shake.  In order to pitch the concept to investors, the business case will need to demonstrate due diligence in planning and establish confidence in a positive return on investment.  W. Avy is willing to take on the project, if I can show our plan will avoid the rain-related mistakes that his previous surf shop could not overcome. W. Avy has provided weather station data from Oahu for this analysis.

- June's average temperature is 74.9 degrees, December is only slightly cooler with an average temperature of 71 degrees.
- June's max temperature was 85 degrees, and December's nearly the same at 83 degrees.
- December's minimum temperature was 56 degrees, 8 degrees colder than June's (64 degrees).
- December's standard deviation was negligibly higher (3.75 degrees to June's 3.26).

# Summary
Due to the tropical nature of the location studied, the seasonal impact of the weather is quite mild in Oahu.  Average temperature and monthly minimum and maximum temperatures are fairly consistent from June compared to December.<br>
Given W. Avy's concerns with respect to rain, refactoring some queries allows us to show seasonal rainfall patterns as well.<br>

Other potential queries for each month to establish coldest and wettest months may also help W. Avy feel confident in investing into this one-of-kind venture.
